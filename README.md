# Fullstack Lambs 

This project was **originally meant to be a group project** (3–4 people),  
but I ended up doing it completely alone.

There are still a few small bugs (which even the teacher couldn’t fix),  
but I gave it my best and learned a lot during the process. I really enjoyed this project!

The app is a **fullstack PHP-based web app** created for a band,  
with login, calendar functions, and basic UI built with old-school tech.

## Built with:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- PHP  
- MySQL

## Video Presentations. 
These videos were made for my teacher to show how the app works,  
so the tone is casual and relaxed; nothing too serious.

## Notes

This was my first time doing a fullstack project like this alone.  
It’s not perfect, but I’m proud of the result.
